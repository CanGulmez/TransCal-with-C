# TransCal - Transistor Calculator

TransCal project was developed to make transistors analyzes 
automatically. This project contains mostly used configurations.
I've seperated it in three part. 

First part named `BJT` contain BJT configurations like 
voltage-divider or common-base. 
Second part named `JFET` contain JFET configurations. 
Third and last part named `MOSFET` contain basics E-MOSFET 
configuration. 

There is no part related D-MOSFET. Because JFET and D-MOSFET 
analyzes are same things. 

Of course, I may have made mistake in some methods. Please, 
contact the with me over my e-mail address.
